# Wireless-BPSK-Simulation
This script takes in a data sequence ,modulates it using the BPSK
modulation technique and plays it over a computer speaker, simultaneously
recording the played sound throught the computer's microphone after which
the signal is decoded to get back data message.

You can validate by changing the data sequence under step 1 in the data variable. 
The output is expected to print to the MATLAB command window or can be found in the out variable under the step 14 section.
